# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. We work for a software engineering company named Global Rain. Artemis had hird Global Rain to protect their client data and financial information.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  One of the strengths of this project was generating checksum values based on various different encryption algorithms to ensure data validation regardless of security protocol. Coding securely should be the most important aspect of coding, regardless of the scope of the application; ensuring the customers data security as well as that of the company.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The part I found most challenging was using maven. With all the reading that we had done, Maven was still an issue to me, I started learing most as the course went on but overall, I think I would like to brush up more on Maven. 

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  To make certain the code and software application was funcional and secure, we ran test to verify that it passed. Once this test has passed we would find the HTML file to see what if we had any new vulnerabilities. 

  # What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    The rescources, tools and coding practices that might be helpful in future assignments are the reading material we were provided throughout this course. The reading material we were provided gave really helful information that I learned from. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would showcase the vulernatiblity reports, or more accurately, the documentation and interpretation I developed based on the reports findings. I believe that understanding security reports such as that are an essential aspect of web development, especially for future employers.
